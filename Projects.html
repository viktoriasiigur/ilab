In the classical university and course, even though the topic might be intetresting for me, falling asleep in lecture is very likely to happen. Here, everything seemed to be different from the very beginning. First several days were totally exhausting, probably because I experienced a lot of new things and I was very much out of my comfort zone. Biggest challenge for me was speaking in English, I didn't practice it at all before I came to Austria. It was hard to get used to it. I didn't feel free talking with people whom I don't know. Presenting made me feel very uncomfortable. As we all know, if you are afraid to do something, do it with fear. This is the only way to move on and be successful in the future. And that's what I did.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-3">When real iLab work started, I didn't know what to expect. Everything was new and even a bit scary, because with new structure of learning you cannot ever know, if you are doing something wrong or is everything as it has to be. I felt myself very insecure and because of that I didn't want to talk much. Even though I liked my topic and nature is very close to my heart. All these presentations and team meetings were very tough for me, because I sometimes felt like third wheel. My teammates had considerable discussions and I was sad, because I couldn't be able to give my ideas to them. I think, that main reason for me was the language barrier back then. I was always afraid to be wrong.&nbsp;I was totally frustrated after first gate presentation, because I forgot everything I wanted to say and I felt ashamed because of that. It wasn't easy for me at all. But because of these cases, I saw every meeting and presentation that this situation is becoming better and better. I started to communicate with other people outside of school and I practiced my communication skills every day and very often. Due to these improvements, I could be very proud of my presenting on the gate 2 presentation. Even if it wasn't the best performance in my history, I was super happy, that I developed with not that long time quite a lot in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify-xl u-text u-text-2">After several weeks of research and different ideas we came up with a solution - for saving the bees and through bees also the environment, we decided to implement all in one kit for planting flowers, which seeds are specially picked to give the best food for pollinators. Kit includes easily installable box, pack of soil, seeds and online tutorial for setting up the box, starting with planting and keeping flowers alive as long as possible. My task was to create the last part of the kit - webpage for all of these tutorials. Before the gate 2, I had to make the prototype for it.</p>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">motions about the upcoming journey in the team were good. At the first moment, when I understood that we won’t continue with our previous project, in which we put a lot of energy, I was for sure a bit disappointed, because the product we wanted to create was already so r<span style="font-weight: 400;">ealistic in our minds. But besides that, I was happy that I ended up in exactly this team. It was also my first choice in every gate.&nbsp;The problem that our t</span>
            </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">eam wants to solve is very important. And I feel related to it. I never played with dolls in my childhood, I always had different interests than other girls. I liked to ride with a motorcycle. Even now, I work as a programmer, which is not a very common job among women. And I have felt different kind of opinions about that. Everyone should know that all people have their own rights to do whatever they want to do and be whoever they want to be. I don’t want to let my friends change their thoughts just because there are people who don't accept them as they are.</span>&nbsp;</b>
          <span style="font-weight: 400;"> That's why I was very motivated to be in this team and work with them to make future brighter.&nbsp;</span>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">first cycle was the toughest one for the team. 50% of the members were new and all of us had to get used to others' and their way of working. We had a lot of problems with communication and sometimes it was very difficult to make compromises to each other. But with the help of our coaches, who gave us good feedback and helped to raise acceptance in each of us, we came over this problem. And we became a good team. Besides our problems, we were able to create the main frame of our book and characters for all of the stories. We decided to make 7 stories and all of them represent some situations with families and creatures, who are outside of social gender borders. All the children characters have gender neutral names and we don’t emphasize their gender in any case. Their parents have jobs, which are against social normality, for example dad can be make-up artist or mum firefighter. Also not all of the families are traditional ones - some of them have two mums or two dads or one parent or family with patchwork structure. Everything is accepted in our book. We also created the full idea of the story 1, we had a detailed plan for financing the book and we had collected most of the ideas, how to advertise the book and make it visible for many people. But most of all, we learned from this cycle a lot. We learned, how to accept, how to communicate and how to work together even though we have different approaches to work and life in general. We also understood that good communication is the key for a successful team. And it helped us to move on.&nbsp;</span></b>
